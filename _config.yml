  AI/ML 연구실에서 연구를 하며 석사과정을 마친 학생으로 현재 현업에 뛰어들 준비를 하고 있습니다.<br/>
  학부생때부터 꾸준히 기업 혹은 정부 과제를 수행하며 실무 경험을 쌓아왔습니다. 새로운 방법론 혹은 기술에 대해 열정적으로 공부하며, 수행하는 과제에서 처음 접한 기술들을 소화하여
  성공적으로 과제를 마무리하였습니다.<br/>
  개인이 하고 싶은 일 보다는 <mark>팀원들과 과제 수행에 도움이 되는</mark> 개발을 해야 한다는 생각에 Andorid App Programming, PyQt, Unity 등 새로운 기술을
  스스로 공부하며 과제를 수행하기도 했습니다.<br/>
  <mark>주도적으로</mark> 업무를 수행하는 것을 좋아하며, 관심 있는 분야의 트렌드를 파악하고 구현하며 <mark>새로운 지식에 대한 탐구하는 것을</mark> 좋아합니다.

  현재는 <mark>Neural Radiance Field</mark>와 <mark>3D-aware GAN</mark> 등을 주로 연구하며 개인 프로젝트를 진행하고 있습니다.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.
